### Semantic Segmentation with UNet, Albumentations, and PyTorch

This guided project implements a complete semantic segmentation pipeline using PyTorch and the segmentation_models.pytorch library. It includes a custom Dataset class for paired image-mask loading, Albumentations-based augmentation, and a full training loop. The model is built on a pretrained UNet backbone and demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, augmentation, and modular training design â€” ideal for showcasing deep learning skills in computer vision.

### Key Technologies
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- Albumentations: Fast and flexible image augmentation
- segmentation_models.pytorch: Pretrained segmentation architectures
- OpenCV: Image loading and preprocessing
- NumPy & Matplotlib: Data manipulation and visualization
